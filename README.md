# Super Korok: Trash-Man game

### About the project:
Super Korok: Trash-Man game is a game inspired by Pac-Man. It is a serious game that draws attention to the pollution of forests with garbage. 

### Lore and additional information:

A long, long time ago, there was a man named Ganondorf. He was a chief of a desert village. Nowadays, sadly, he lost his mind and started to litter all over the Hyrule with Bokogoblinsâ€™ help. After about a week, almost whole Hyrule was clean again because of a help of every citizen. 

But there is a place called Korok Forest, where not everyone can enter. Little creatures called Koroks to this day are trying to clean their forest, but with no effect as they are too weak. In this game, you become Makar - bravest of all Koroks, who decided to take the matters into his own hands and clean Korok Forest.

Be careful - in this journey you can meet not so friendly Bokogoblins. Good luck! Yahahaha

#### How to play?
- You can control Makar using WSAD keys.
- There are 4 parts of Korok Forest, where you have to get all the selected type of trash, highlighted on top of the screen.
- For each good type of trash, you get +1 point, otherwise -2 points.
- As Bokogoblins are too strong for Makar, every time you try to fight with them, you lose 1 heart. 

Try to clean Korok Forest as fast as possible, Ganondorf can come at any moment!
